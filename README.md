# Bookshelf

A modern one-page app to help you manage your book collection. Avoid that awkward moment where you realize you've already read that book you just bought! Add books, organize them into shelves (to be read,wishlist,favorites,etc), and get new suggestions based on your favorites.

As a book hoarder, I know how hard it is to keep track of what books you have, which ones you've read, and which ones you want to read!
